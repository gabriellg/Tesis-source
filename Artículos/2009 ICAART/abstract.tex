\fontsize{9}{11}\selectfont A formal grammar-based model is presented to integrate 
the essential characteristics of a Multi-Agent System with the visualization given 
by an Interactive Graphic Systems. This model adds
several advantages, such as the separation between the implementation of the system activity and
the hardware devices, or the easy reusability of components. 
To illustrate the model, a practical case is presented.
